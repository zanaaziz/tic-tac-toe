# Tic Tac Toe in Python
A little two player game of Tic Tac Toe in the Python console.

# How To Play
- Upon running the 'game.py' file, the first player will be prompted to make a move.
- While it is possible to play with the numbers at the top of your keyboard, a keyboard with a numeric keypad is highly recommended. (GUI limitations...sorry)
- Using the keypad, enter the corresponding number for the position of your move and press enter.
- Then, player two will be prompted to make their move.
- Once the match ends, you will be prompted with an option to either rematch or end the game.
